This is a short script that I wrote for a coding challenge.
The program fetches a list of partners from a remote API and outputs the company names and addresses of matching partners (with offices within 100km of central London) sorted by company name (ascending).
The program is written in only vanilla Javascript, using no frameworks or external libraries.
